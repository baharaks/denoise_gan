Deep Learning Model for Image Processing
Overview
This project leverages PyTorch to implement a deep learning model focused on image processing tasks. It includes a dataset preparation script, model definitions for both generator and discriminator components, a training script, and a prediction script to evaluate the model's performance on new data.

Files

dataset.py: Prepares and loads the dataset. Defines custom transformations and a data loader for training and validation datasets.

model.py: Contains the model architecture. Defines the generator and discriminator classes, including the initialization of layers and forward passes.

training.py: Script for training the model. It initializes the model, sets up the loss functions and optimizers, and contains the training loop.

prediction.py: Provides functionality to make predictions with a trained model. It also includes evaluation metrics to assess performance.

Installation
To run these scripts, ensure you have Python 3.8+ and PyTorch installed. You can install the necessary dependencies via pip:

pip install torch torchvision

Prepare the dataset by running the dataset preparation script:

python dataset.py

Train the model using the training script. You can adjust hyperparameters as needed:

python training.py

Make predictions with the trained model by running the prediction script:

python prediction.py
